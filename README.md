If your can't use ctrl and you don't have key to replace it, you can change shift to ctrl but still can use shift. For example if you click 'shift+c' it will send 'ctrl+c', but if you click 'shift+q' or just 'shift' it will still send 'shift+q' or just 'shift'. You can also combined it with different script like change alt to shift, so whenever you click 'alt+c' it will send  'ctrl+c'. This script usefull if you don't use shift+ctrl command and want to change ctrl command to shift. You can also use it as template for another key if you want to do the same.
